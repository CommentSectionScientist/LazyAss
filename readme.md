# Lazy Ass

## Purpose

App to show Notifications after X Seconds, after u unlocked your phone the last time.

My personal usage: Don't forget the time when browsing your phone between your workout sets.

## Backlog
- Make a click on the Notification open the app
- Clean up the mess around the use of the `AlarmManager` (it seems to not work with Extras in Intents, which lead to copied/unused code)
- Scheduled Notifications get canceled when the phone gets locked/turnd off
- Write Unit/Integration/UI tests
- Clean up the rest
- Change from input field to sth that only provides Integers
- add minutes/hours
